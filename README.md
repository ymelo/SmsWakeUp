SmsWakeUp
=========

A non intrusive app that will turn the screen of your device on when receiving a text message (sms).
Not every device has the ability to alert you (front facing LED or something else) when you receive a sms.
This application does one thing. It turns the device's screen on when a sms is received.

This app is not really meant for distribution, but can be reused for teaching purposes.
